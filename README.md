## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 5
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

---

## 💡 How It Works

- Music files are stored locally in the `mp3/` folder and are played dynamically through JavaScript.
- All operations (such as displaying the playlist, updating the UI, and controlling playback) are handled with **DOM manipulation**.
- Even though the number of tracks is currently limited, it can be easily expanded with additional songs.
- The interface is styled using **Bootstrap**, making it responsive and compatible with most modern browsers and mobile devices.
